# Day One

Today I focused on integrating Mapbox with React. I successfully set up the Mapbox component and configured it to display a map.

Tomorrow, my plan is to implement the draw component, allowing users to draw, modify, and delete polygons.

# Day Two

Still figuring out my approach to this. Was looking into a lot of React Mapbox and React Mapbox draw. A lot of the documentation seems to be out of date will probably circle around and take a different approach.

# Day Three

- Drawing Controls: Provides controls for drawing polygons and deleting drawn features.
- Event Handling: Implements callback functions to handle drawing events, such as creation, deletion, and updates.
- Customizable Configuration: Allows for customization of drawing options and map configurations.
- State Management: Uses React hooks to manage the state of map drawings.
