# Day One

Today I focused on integrating Mapbox with React. I successfully set up the Mapbox component and configured it to display a map.

Tomorrow, my plan is to implement the draw component, allowing users to draw, modify, and delete polygons.

## Resources
- [React Mapbox](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-map-gl)
- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)

Feel free to check out the links above for more information on the tools and libraries I used.
